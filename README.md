# 🚗 Accident Risk Predictor
This project is an interactive Streamlit web application that predicts the accident risk level for a given set of road and environmental conditions.
It uses a trained hybrid ensemble model to estimate risk based on factors such as speed limit, curvature, lighting, weather, and more.

In addition, there is a dashboard to find data trends & insights from the training dataset. The insights are concluded as a one page executive summary for the authorities looking into road safetry measures.

## 🔍 Features
